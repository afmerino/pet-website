<p> I never stayed with Cleo, because she was my dad's cat and he lived in New York. My sister and I would visit ever Summer and see all 6 of his and his wife's cats, but none were ever as close to me as Cleo was. She would always come lay down on my stomach when it was time for bed and she would never want to leave my side. Even though I would be sick from all of her cat hair, me being allergic to cats and dogs, I never cared. My dad would hear me sneezing at night and would move her away form me sometimes.</p>
<P align="center"> A memory I'll never forget is when I came back to New York and I saw her for the first time in years and she genetically blew up! She went from a regular sized skinny cat to a big boned cat.</P>
